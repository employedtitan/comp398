### API Proposal

	For our API we are planning on being able to store and add movies, the directors, the rating, the run time, and the genre that were released in 1994. The app will be called 1994movies. The URI will be http://1994movies/(insert search criteria here).  Using our app the user will be able to search for their favorite movies from 1994 based on the movie’s director, runtime, rating (based on IMDB’s rating system), run time, genre, or even by the title of the movie.  Users of our app will be able to search the database entries based on any of the data contained in each entry to the database, so they will be able to search all movies in the database made by a specific director.  The user will be able to add their own entries and we the apps administrators will be able to delete movies that were not released in 1994 or otherwise do not adhere to the rules of the database.  Users will be able to edit entries to add data, such as adding information, like director or genre, if that data is missing or correcting the information if it is incorrect.  Users will also be able to fix the database by deleting entries that do not conform to the standards of the database.
